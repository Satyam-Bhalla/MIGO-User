## MAY I GO OUT (MIGO)? 
### DESCRIPTION: 
An interactive interface between the government and the citizens on  which the citizens can raise a request and get time-bound permission to go out for  essential needs and in case of an emergency. 
### PROBLEM STATEMENT 
With the increased strictness of the lockdown to contain the spread of coronavirus in  India, citizens are facing a lot of trouble in procuring basic necessities for their  homes. Also, videos are getting viral wherein the police is beating citizens who are  out on the road, is creating a lot of panic in the minds of the common man and is  only adding to the dilemma of the people. 
The Government is although taking a lot of steps to control the spread of COVID-19,  however there is always a slight communication gap between the government and  the citizens. We wish to fill this gap by developing a cross-platform  (Mobile/Tablet/PCs) application, which can help both the government and the  citizens effectively communicate and survive through this adversity 
### SOLUTION 
An ultimate solution to manage citizens outside their homes, and an interactive way  to establish effective communication between the government and the citizens. 
Features: - 
1.) Citizens can raise request on their apps to get approvals to outside  their homes to get essential items. 
2.) Automated approval system can be configured by the government to  allow a specific number of citizens to go out on streets or in a specific  region to control rush. 
3.) An embedded News Feed where the government can spread crucial  information/updates on COVID-19.
4.) Interactive dashboard for the government to monitor the number of  people outside and punish the offenders.  
### BENEFITS 
1.)  An application for the public which will help them to raise a limited number of  requests in a week and the law enforcement agencies like police can check  whether the individual is allowed or not.  
2.) Government authorities to monitor hourly the number of people on road and  also with enough flexibility for the authorities to change the amount of people  allowed as per the situation.  
3.) This not only will help to develop the communication between government  and public but also will help to maintain peace and law and easier for the  police workforce to handle a definite amount of people during a period. 
4.) Government can use this portal to provide important updates regarding Covid 19 to the citizens, this will establish a secure communication but also prevent  the spread of fake news. 
5.) Citizens can also come forward and report incidents/suggestions on how to  fight the coronavirus as a single nation. 
6.) Automatic control on the citizens ensures the law enforcement agencies can  get some relief and only a limited workforce is required to manage the  citizens. 
### PROCESS WORKFLOW – LOGIC  
Considering the fact that the authorities are already occupied in fighting coronavirus,  and it would be difficult for them to approve citizens’ requests to go out one-by-one,  hence we have devised an automated algorithm, which can provide the authorities, freedom to set how many people can go out in a period of time. And only the set  number of citizens can go out in a particular area for that period. This number can  always be altered as per the situation by the government and hence the number of  citizens outside can always be managed with very little workforce. A dashboard  visualisation of the number of people who have been granted the permission to go  out area wise can be viewed by the authorities.  
The government can also use the application to convey important updates to the  citizens to keep them well informed about the situation and COVID-19. Area specific  information can also be pushed to the public through this medium. 
### PROCESS WORKFLOW – USER INTERFACE 
#### USER REGISTRATION - 
The application is designed in such a manner that a user  on installing the app gets a prompt to register with their basic information and the  area name/ward name. On OTP authentication the user is registered with the  database and now the user can raise new requests on the application. A registered  user can view insights about the requests raised and a relevant dashboard. 
#### REQUESTS CATEGORY – 
##### 1.) Regular –
A user who needs permission to go out to procure essential items  or for a healthcare need can request this. The user is prompted to select a 
slot as per requirement. After selecting the slot, the user is added to the  Request-Queue, and as per the slots available, the user is allotted a time  bound token to go out.A user can raise a maximum of ‘y’ Regular requests in a week. If a user has  exceeded ‘y’ requests, then they are not allowed to raise more request for that  week.  
##### 2.) Emergency –
A user in case of an emergency, can utilize this option and  request for permission to go out. Based upon the request, a user may/ may  not get the permission. If the permission is granted, the user gets a token to  go out.  
A user can raise a maximum of ‘x’ Emergency requests in a week. If a user  has exceeded ‘x’ requests, then they are not allowed to raise more requests  for that week.  
• Note – ‘x’ and ‘y’ can be set as per the requirement by the authority. Please find the link below for the flowchart:
